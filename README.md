### About the Project

Not just a solution, a better future.

Discovering exoplanets has always been a challenge — but with AI, we can push the boundaries. Our system uses a single powerful model trained on a combined dataset from NASA’s Kepler and K2 missions, making predictions on whether a planet is more likely to be a candidate or confirmed.

---

How We Made It Possible:

- Trained Random Forest model on merged Kepler + K2 datasets.
- Allowed users to upload their own CSV data or enter values manually.
- Interactive dashboard updates dynamically with user predictions.

From Idea to Impact:

With just a few clicks, you can explore how NASA’s data  combined with your own  is transformed into insights by machine learning.
